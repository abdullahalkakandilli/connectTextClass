"Over the course of 30 days I have filed a dispute in regards to inaccurate and false information on my credit report. Ive attached a copy of my dispute mailed in certified to Equifax and they are still reporting these incorrect items. According to the fair credit ACT, section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) they are required by Federal Law to only report Accurate information and the have not done so. They have not provided me with any proof i.e. and original consumer contract with my signature on it proving that this is my account.Further more, I would like to make a formal complaint that Ive tried calling Equifax Over 10 times this week and every single time Ive called Ive asked for a representative in the fraud dispute department wants transfer it over there when you speak to the representative and let them know that you are looking to dispute inquiries and accounts due to fraud they immediately transfer you to their survey line essentially ending the call. I believe Equifax is training their representatives to not help consumers over the phone and performing unethical practices. Once I finally got a hold of a representative she told me that she could not help because I did not send in my Social Security card which violates my consumer rights. So Im Making a formal CFPB complaint that you will correct Equifaxs actions."
It appears a medical vendor failed to disclose total amount of charges and failed to contact me directly about sums due. Sent to collections without notice to me and collection agent failed to contact me or confirm contact.
"Our mortgage servicing company Loancare performing fraudulent practices. After we sent payment deferment agreement, I called to pay out escrow account which was created unlawfully and the company applied payment to 2 months which were in forbearance and later were included in deferment agreement. Nobody in the company is willing to resolve an issue. Also we are not able to make payment online."
A credit card was opened in my name with Suntrust Bank.I have a fraud alert on my credit report stating to contact me at my phone number prior to issuing any new credit. Suntrust has closed the account but not tell me why this account was opened without contacting me first.
"I have never had a late payment and Wells Fargo is showing multiple late payments. As well, they are not reflecting the correct balance of my loan. I have asked multiple times customer service to correct this information and they have done nothing."
"My bank periodically does not allow me to log in to my account, and at times it takes up to 3 months before they are able to fix the problem. This lack of access to my account does not allow me to access information or make any transactions other than use my ATM card. I never had this problem under my old bank. It only started when that bank was taken over. From what I have been reading, the present bank has fraudulently been using some of their customers money to open unauthorized accounts. I have been told that I can make a wire transfer of funds, but that would cost me $40.00, which I would not have to pay if I had access to my online account. This appears like a way for the bank to charge me an unnecessary fee."
"I sent a payment to a coworker. This payment was returned and both of our accounts were frozen. They asked us for our ID Cards. We both sent in our Driver's Licenses. Then my account was closed, with 2000.00 in it. And I was told I had to wait 180 days for the money to be returned to me. I read their Terms of Service and the transaction with my coworker in no way violated their terms of service. I reached out to them again for an explanation and am not being given an answer as to what rule I violated. I feel like their algorithms are running wild and canceling accounts with no human oversight, as if a human were to look into this I don t believe my account would be canceled. I need access to my money, it is a lot of money to me, and is creating undo stress and hardships for me."
